Virtual Drag and Drop using Computer Vision! 



In this project, I developed an interactive application that uses AI-powered hand tracking to drag and drop virtual objects on the screen. Utilizing cvzone, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, this project highlights the potential of combining computer vision with real-time interactivity.



Key Features:

Tracks hand landmarks with high accuracy using MediaPipe.

Implements real-time object manipulation with intuitive gestures.

Seamlessly overlays virtual objects with transparency for a sleek UI.



What I learned:

This project deepened my understanding of:

Gesture-based control systems.

Building interactive interfaces with Python and OpenCV.

Debugging real-time applications for performance optimization.



Tech Stack:

Python

cvzone

MediaPipe

OpenCV



I believe gesture-based systems have exciting potential in fields like gaming, AR/VR, and accessibility tools. This project is just a step forward in exploring these opportunities!
